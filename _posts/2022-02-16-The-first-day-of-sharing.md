## The first blog post.

Right now I am in my 4th week of college classes. I am ahead in the 3 classes I am taking and I plan to keep it that way. 
Before I started these classes I started my journey by working my way through the beginners course of TryHackMe.

Today in my classes I learned what a nano server is. I learned that it is a server with a very limited user interface and that the only way to manage
anything deeper then the set up is to use remote management tools. 

I also started learning about IPv4 addressing. From TryHackMe I had learned some things about what IP's were but I dont have the best understanding of them. 
In this section that I am working on I am excited to learn more about IPs and what a Subnet Mask is.
