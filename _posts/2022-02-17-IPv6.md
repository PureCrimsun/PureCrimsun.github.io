Instead of using 32 bits to define an IP address like IPv4 does, IPv6 uses 128 bits to define an IPv6 address.
IPv6 addresses are composed of eight four-character hexadecimal numbers. Each one of these four-character hexadecimal numbers is called a quartet.
These quartets are separated by a full colon now, instead of a period.

With a hexadecimal address the numbers go from 0-9 and then go to A,B,C,D,F then you start over.

An IPv6 address is divided into two parts. The first 64 bits of an IPv6 address is the prefix. 
The prefix is composed of the network address, as well as the subnet address for the IP network.

because of the huge address space available with IPv6 addresses, we don't need to create all the custom subnet masks that we did with IPv4. 
Instead, pretty much everybody just uses a 64-bit prefix. There are exceptions, but they are kind of rare.
Therefore, at the end of the address, we can just put /64 to indicate that our prefix is 64 bits long.

The last part of the address is the interface ID, which is basically the same thing as the IPv4 host portion of the address.

You can abbreviate IPv6 addresses by putting a double colon between where the zeros start and where the zeros end. You can only use the Abbreviation once in the address.
