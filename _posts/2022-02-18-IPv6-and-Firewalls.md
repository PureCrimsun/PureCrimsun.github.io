Unique IPv6 addresses always start with FC00: or FD00:

Public addresses/Global-Unicast start with the numbers 2 or 3.

Link local starts with FE8.

Multicast starts with FF.

When assigning static IPv6 addresses you will have 2 ipv6 addresses show up when you run an ipconfig. 
You dont need to worry about the Link-local address this address is auto assigned to the system even if you dont set up a static IP address.

Connection Security Rules is IPSec in the advanced Firewall settings.
